Description: The "SVMFeature" R package presents a comprehensive suite for Support Vector 
  Machine (SVM) modeling enhanced with advanced featurization capabilities. Alongside standard 
  SVM functionalities, it introduces a cutting-edge genetic algorithm tailored for 
  multi-objective optimization tasks. This genetic algorithm utilizes a combination of techniques, 
  including initial population creation, fast non-dominated sorting, tournament dominance 
  selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism. By integrating these techniques, "SVMFeature" 
  facilitates efficient optimization of SVM models while overcoming common challenges like 
  overfitting. For detailed insights into the algorithm and usage guidelines, please consult 
  the vignette.
