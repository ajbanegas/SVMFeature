# SVMFeature
The "SVMFeature" R package presents a comprehensive suite for Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling enhanced with advanced featurization capabilities. Alongside standard SVM functionalities, it introduces a cutting-edge genetic algorithm tailored for multi-objective optimization tasks. This genetic algorithm utilizes a combination of techniques, including initial population creation, fast non-dominated sorting, tournament dominance selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism. By integrating these techniques, "FeatureSVM" facilitates efficient optimization of SVM models while overcoming common challenges like overfitting. For detailed insights into the algorithm and usage guidelines, please consult the vignette.

# Installation
You can install the released version of the package from CRAN with:
```R
install.packages("SVMFeature")
```
And the development version from GitHub with:
